LoL Team Checker
================

A small python Tkinter-based [League of Legends](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/) application that allows you to view your team mate's individual and team's average ranked statistics.

Usage:
* Run the application. 
* Enter summoner names and champions
* Press "Go", "Individual Stats", or "Team Stats". 

Team stats are displayed in two flavours: 
* "Equally Weighted Averages" (as if all players had the same number of games) 
* "Averages" (where contribution is weighted by the player's number of games).
