Class differences/redundancies:
----------------------------------
This applies mainly to the new, smaller app: LoLTeamCheck

Each class is meant to only work on its own data - i.e. I want to avoid 
importing classes into other classes. 

Current issue: Redundant references
Classes: staticdata.py & rankeddata.py

In order to get ranked data for a champ for a summoner, I could use, in my GUI:

(1)
idnum = GrabStaticSata.get_champid("Jarvan IV")
stats = GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_id(idnum)

OR, 
(2)
in GrabRankedData, I could sort the data from:
stats = api_instance.get_ranked_stats_by_summoner_id(id)


which comes as:
a list in stats['champions'], with stats['champions'][0]['stats'] &
stats['champions'][0]['id']

into:
new_stats['Jarvan IV'] with ['stats'] and ['id'] which means calling:
GrabStaticData.get_champid(name) for each champ

then use GrabRankedData.get_stats_by_name("Jarvan IV")

===============================================================================
Major Stuff:
-------------------
1. Make the model. Currently all important info is being played with inside the
controller. DONE

2. Find a better way to do the imports (redundant imports), and *maybe* 
refactor so that the controller calls the GUI in main.py, not the other way 
around.	DONE

3. Find a better way to convert Riot's JSON names to my headers.

4. Sort out the StringVar()/IntVar() issue. Currently all variables are 
StringVar(), but that will be problematic for adding, etc. DONE (see 8.?)

5. Currently pressing tab cycles you through each row in a column, instead of 
vice-versa. Should be [S.Name]->[C.Name]->"Go!". Refactor code for this.

6. In the controller, do I really want to be passing arguments continuously to
the model's methods? The only alternatives I can currently think of would be
to:

(1) call each successive method in the current method:

def _get_ranked_data(self, summoner_name, champ_name):

	self.id = get-summoner-id
	data = GrabRankedData(...self.id)
	self._get_champ_stats(champ_name)

def _get_champ_stats(self, summoner_name, champ_name):
	etc.

(2)	save persistent attributes, and call them in each method (i.e. arguments 
already inside the method)

controller.py:
def _process_line(self, i):
        [summoner_name, champ_name] = self.get_user_values(i)
		self.model.take_these_vars(summoner_name, champ_name)
        self.model._get_summoner_data()
        self.model._get_ranked_data()
        self.model._get_champ_stats()
    
model.py
def 

7. Deal with weird character encodings. DONE (need to test)
not thorough - try: u'aet\xf8s'

8. Find out how people do floats as (Tk.var()). Either:

(1) Write a method to convert to float, do the maths, convert back to 
StringVar()

(2) Check for native methods for floats (because IntVar rounds).

SORT OF DONE - DoubleVar() doesn't work for strings - i.e. "Prediction".

9. Write appropriate try...except methods for invalid summoner names and 
champion names. Requires changes to riotapi_py (get error codes: 404, 503, 
etc.), LoLTeamCheckerGUI (appropriate message boxes), and 
LoLTeamCheckerController (maybe a _catch_error() called in _process_line()?).

More importantly, make sure things are handled in the appropriate places.
(1) riotapi must return a riotapiexception. DONE
(2) the MODEL must check for thrown/raised exceptions. DONE

10. Reduce redundant api calls - i.e. if "Go" is pressed, and the summoner
exists, then ranked stats will be saved in the Model. No need to recall the
api when a legitimate champion (one that the summoner has played) has stats.
DONE

11. If a champ's stats are successfully called, the next unsuccessful champion
call will not produce an error. Fix:
(1) Make sure error message pops up.
(2)	Reset all fields to "0".
DONE

12. IMPORTANT:
Model needs to be restructured in terms of its try...except loops - i.e. they
should stop after an exception.
DONE

13. Need a test suite for all possible conditions.

14. Rework the model in terms of .data and .final_stats to accommodate:
1. _get_summary_stats() fails if called multiple times because .final_stats
will have dicts that have 'Total Games' and dicts that don't.
2. Uniform naming across basic JSON stats and final stats, like 
"totalSessionsPlayed" vs "Total Games" - EWAve is the issue
3. If a player that was initially checked does not comprise the 5 now checked,
make sure he isn't added to the totals, this actually applies to all players 
looked up during the session. i.e. find a way to capture current state. DONE

15. "get all stats" and "get summary stats" don't always work! FIXED,
but sometimes (when?) don't update individual lines

16. Add a boolean flag so that certain errors are only thrown (hence error
boxes only pop up) when _process_line is accessed on its own, not via 
_process_all. DONE DIFFERENTLY (no flag)

17. Fix dicts, handling of _set_summary_values() or whatever it's called. 
DONE?

18. Write some tests/just test that EWA[KDA] is being worked out properly.

19. It appears as if having multiple champs for one summoner messes up 
calculations (first hypothesis: final_stats needs a [name] key, like:

final_stats[summoner][champ][stats] (where stats is a list) instead of:

final_stats[summoner][champ stats] (where champ_stats is the list)). DONE

20. Rework EWAve and Ave, that shit is messed up.
===============================================================================
Small QOL Stuff:
-------------------
1. Make sure champion names can be entered into the GUI in a case insensitive
form - i.e.:
(1) convert the static data list stored locally into a list with one case,

and, 
(2) make sure the entry from the GUI gets converted before being checked.

DONE - was harder, and implemented in a weirder way than I initially thought.

So, maybe staticdata needs to have its dicts done in the form 
{{name: "Amumu", "id": ??}, } so I can .lower() values instead of keys?)

2. Write checks for region (currently LoLTeamCheckerController has "euw" 
hardcoded for its self.api_instance...) DONE

3. Make right, middle, label frames uniform in size (currently don't correspond
to label head sizes).

4. Make fonts smaller, pad for size, etc.

5. Automate frame indexing (i.e. don't call self.frames[explicit number]).

6. Sort out option menu for regions - lock size, make a better drop-down? DONE

7. Use a version of print "{y:2f}".format(y=0.13452) instead of explicit 
rounding?

8. Edit all rehashing dictionary lookups, change from:
for k in d:
    print k, d[k]
	
to:
for k, v in d.items():
    print k, v

9. Sort out sub-framing of summary frame.	

10. Make sure summoner names have a case-insensitive feature, i.e. 
if "NadsOfMahen" has been searched, don't re-lookup "nadsofmahen" if entered.
Best way is probably to change all storage(like .model.data and 
.model.final_stats), and checks (if summoner in .model.data, etc.), into 
lower-case versions.
	
Misc.:

1. Create all frames [x]
===============================================================================
Things I learned/to ponder:
---------------------------
1. Mixing dicts, lists:
One of the more annoying issues I had was finding a way to capture the current
5 names of summoners and champs, and use comprehensions when those 5 summoner 
names weren't unique (i.e. 5 of the same person). The method to grab the names 
would return a list, [x, x, x, x, x]. But the different champs for that 
summoner (x) would be stored as:

.model.final_stats[x][champ_a],
.model.final_stats[x][champ_b], etc.

So if I wanted the total number of games for the rare case of one summoner, 
using a sum over the list comprehension:

num_games = sum([[name][champ]['Games'] for name in names for champ in champs])

would find .model.final_stats[x][champ_a]...[champ_b], then iterate over the 
length of the name list [x, x, x, x, x]. Since this is a unique case, and a 
rare one, I could have written a special catch, but I did it using zip. That
way, I preserved the original name gets as lists, not dicts 
(i.e. {x, x, x, x, x}).
